### Log 2: Think Piece

<p> I wish to conduct a study of affect in Richard Wright’s infamous protest novel, *Native Son* (1940).  Wright has been criticized for years as the main character, 20-year-old African American Bigger Thomas, living in Chicago’s South Side in the 1930s, shows little remorse for his violent actions.  Wright’s unapologetic portrayal of Bigger sheds light upon the systematic inevitability behind the crimes committed throughout the novel.  Likewise, Wright, though the narrative voice, makes no effort to apologize for Bigger’s crimes, but instead sheds light upon the systematic inevitability behind them.  Although Bigger’s crimes provide the action for the narrative, the real story rests in the way Bigger responds to environmental influences.  Bigger’s inability to identify the social conditions imposed upon African Americans by the dominant white society which have led to his demise reflects his emotional stiltedness.  Even at the end of the novel, Bigger is unable to explain the circumstances he was placed in which led to his demise – instead, a lawyer speaks on his behalf.  I wish to illustrate how this inability to articulate one’s emotions is prevalent throughout the entire piece through the combination and conflation of emotions, as Bigger identifies them.To accomplish this goal, I will produce a force directed graph, a type of network visualization.  Using identified emotions within the text as my dataset, this type of visualization will present the interconnectedness of emotions and signify which relationships are strongest based on thickness of connecting line.  Additionally, within this model, springs and charged particles will enable the more closely related emotions to appear in closer together than those that lack association in the text.  As Posner recommends, in order to produce this feature, I will need to familiarize myself with the D3.js, a JavaScript library used to create digital visualizations, and Python, a programming language used to manipulate data.  I will produce my own dataset by manually tracking and recording instances of affect within the novel. A larger project, which I hope to complete, would be to incorporate the visualization into a longform, media-rich narrative; my argument would be ideally communicated through the presentation of the visual aid alongside text.  Since my research aims to show the interconnectedness and interdependence of the various emotions, as Bigger understands them, the employment of a network visualization is most appropriate.  Not only will the network make visible and therefore more easily digestible the argument I present, but it will also help me to realize varying strengths of relationships between emotions.  For example, I predict to find more frequent connections between “fear” and “anger” than between “shame” and “power,” which should provide insight into the characterization of Bigger Thomas.  <p/>

### Log 1: After Hermes?

Although I, personally, am not persuaded by Alexander R. Galloway’s argument outlined in “Love of the Middle,” his contribution to Excommunication: Three Inquiries in Media and Mediation (2013), I believe his rhetorical style would prove effective for a specific, and likely his targeted, demographic: the traditional humanities scholar, well-versed in classical literature and Western philosophy.  Galloway proposes a theory of mediation through descriptions of mythological figures Hermes, Iris, and the Furies.  These figures are used to introduce and elucidate the dominant modes of contemporary critical discourse: exegesis, hermeneutics, symptomatics, immanence, and ‘furious’ communication.  All five of these critical approaches are aptly presented by Galloway as forms of mediation – intermediate action between two bodies.  At the climax of his essay, Galloway celebrates the “withering” of “hermeneutic interpretation and immanent iridescence” in exchange for the rise of “the system, the machine, the network” (62).  Not yet having explored the examples Galloway lists later in his piece, I can only speculate what critical scholarship might look like within this new culture.  I foresee the types of scholarship emerging from the “infuriation of distributed systems” to reflect a ‘new’ poststructuralist agenda (62).  Poststructuralists argue against the hermeneutic understanding that exercises such as ‘truth’ finding and meaning-making are legitimate pursuits.  Instead, they suggest that a sort of materiality or particular structure should constitute focus for analysis.  I posit this ascending “network” which Galloway enthusiastically speaks of could fulfill the role of a poststructuralist focus through which analysis could develop.  Why must images and texts experience a “tendential fall” while the machine rises (62)?  I suggest coexistence has the greater potential to be embraced by practitioners of critical inquiry, trained in the tradition of textual analysis, especially since this is the community whom I feel would respond most favourably to Galloway's argumentative style.
