### Log 1: After Hermes?

Although I, personally, am not persuaded by Alexander R. Galloway’s argument outlined in “Love of the Middle,” his contribution to Excommunication: Three Inquiries in Media and Mediation (2013), I believe his rhetorical style would prove effective for a specific, and likely his targeted, demographic: the traditional humanities scholar, well-versed in classical literature and Western philosophy.  Galloway proposes a theory of mediation through descriptions of mythological figures Hermes, Iris, and the Furies.  These figures are used to introduce and elucidate the dominant modes of contemporary critical discourse: exegesis, hermeneutics, symptomatics, immanence, and ‘furious’ communication.  All five of these critical approaches are aptly presented by Galloway as forms of mediation – intermediate action between two bodies.  At the climax of his essay, Galloway celebrates the “withering” of “hermeneutic interpretation and immanent iridescence” in exchange for the rise of “the system, the machine, the network” (62).  Not yet having explored the examples Galloway lists later in his piece, I can only speculate what critical scholarship might look like within this new culture.  I foresee the types of scholarship emerging from the “infuriation of distributed systems” to reflect a ‘new’ poststructuralist agenda (62).  Poststructuralists argue against the hermeneutic understanding that exercises such as ‘truth’ finding and meaning-making are legitimate pursuits.  Instead, they suggest that a sort of materiality or particular structure should constitute focus for analysis.  I posit this ascending “network” which Galloway enthusiastically speaks of could fulfill the role of a poststructuralist focus through which analysis could develop.  Why must images and texts experience a “tendential fall” while the machine rises (62)?  I suggest coexistence has the greater potential to be embraced by practitioners of critical inquiry, trained in the tradition of textual analysis, especially since this is the community whom I feel would respond most favourably to Galloway's argumentative style.
